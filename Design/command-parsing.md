Command Parsing
===============

Where will be many different ways to express the same action a player wants to take. For exmaple leaving the tavern could be expressed in many different ways:

```
> Go outside
> Leave tavern
> Go through doorway
> Exit tavern
> Walk outside
> Walk through doorway
> Go to beach
```

All of them depict the same canonical action of navigating from Tavern to Beach.
